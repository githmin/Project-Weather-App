# Project-Weather-App

This website is a Project of THE ODIN PROJECT. Main focus here was
learning how to use APIs and to learn JS async and await functions. I have used openweathermap.org free 
weather API to get my required weather data.


Vanilla JS, CSS & HTML was used to develop this Project and I have also used webpack on this project.

NOTE :  Responsive design was not in mind while designing this.
